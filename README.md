# Welcome to Robot Turtles!

We are a community excited about having a Robot Turtle wandering around our homes! This is the starting repository, though there are really many repositories you may want to clone, depending on your interest. Here are the main ones:

## Turtle Parts
This is where you will find materials around "physically" making the turtles. Examples include scad/stl files for print out the plastic parts, gerber files for creating the PCB, and parts lists for things you need to buy

## low-level-drivers
This is where we store "operating system" level code and settings. These are drivers for moving the servos, as well as any config files needed. Instructions on how to prepare your raspberry pi are also located here, including any libraries that are expected to be loaded.

## mid-level-routines
Here is where the "AI" lives, though very crude and elemetary at the moment. You'll see software to do basic motor testing, as well as basic commanding of the robot. This is where most of the "exciting" code lives

## home
This is this repo, it will primarily be used to talk about the "overall project", and may be used to host "higher" level events. Such as if we want to create a "maze" for the turtles, maze files would end up being located here.
